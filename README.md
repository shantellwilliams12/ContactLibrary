My project is a PhoneBook console app. The features that are included in my project are a master loop where the user can repeatedly perform 
actions, including choosing to exit the program. An additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent. a log that records errors, invalid 
inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file. Lastly my project displays data based on an external factor.
